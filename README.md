# IATI Refresher
A Python application which has the responsibility of tracking IATI data from around the Web and refreshing the core IATI software's data stores.

Its responsibilities include:

- Downloads IATI data as presented by the IATI registry
- Store and track changes in the source files
- Validate the source files using the IATI Validator API
- Store and index the normalised data in a compressed and performant Postgresql database.

# Local setup
```
docker build .
```

# Local testing
```
docker run --env-file=.env IMAGE_NAME
```

# DB Migrations

For alterations and additions to the database schema, migration files are used. These can be found at https://github.com/IATI/refresher/tree/integrateValidator/src/migrations


Each migration file should have an `upgrade` and a `downgrade` variable, containing the sql required to either upgrade to, or downgrade from, that version. A simple example might be:

```
upgrade = """ALTER TABLE public.refresher
    ADD COLUMN valid boolean;"""

downgrade = """ALTER TABLE public.refresher
    DROP COLUMN valid;"""
```

Before running any task, the Refresher checks the version of the database againsts the version number found at https://github.com/IATI/refresher/blob/integrateValidator/src/constants/version.py. The `__version__` variable in that file is an object with the version number and the corresponding DB migration number. Of course, not every version will require a DB change, but if it does the Refresher will migrate the database either up or down to match the versions, running each step as it goes. So, an upgrade from migration 2 to 4 will run the `upgrade` sql from migration 3 and then 4. A downgrade from 4 to 2 will run the `downgrade` sql from migration 4 and then 3.

Refer to its fine documentation, and then when making migrations change the autogenerated revision name to reflect the version to which it relates, following the convention - ie for version 0.3.1, change it to BR_0_3_1_whatever_message.py
